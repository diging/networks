    "## E.2. Representing a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A network or graph is a collection of nodes (points, vertices) and edges (relations, links). You'll sometimes see people write things like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "G = (V, E)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is just a silly way of saying what I just explained. $V$ are the nodes, $E$ are the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node can be anything. In a social network, nodes represent people. In a computer network, nodes might be various kinds of computers. In a gene regulatory network, nodes represent genes or gene-products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges represent relations between nodes. Depending on the research context, those relations could be just about anything. They could represent the fact that two people know each other, that two machines are connected by cables, or that one gene turns another gene off. The Big Thing That Matters here is that **each edge has two nodes**. In a directed graph, where relations flow in one direction (e.g. gene A downregulates gene B), we call these two nodes the **source** and the **target**. Undirected graphs are graphs in which where relations are symmetric (e.g. two people know each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to assign attributes to edges, especially \"weights\". This might represent, for example, how many times one person sends another person an email in a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing all of that, and recalling notebook [2. Objects and types](2.%20Objects%20and%20types.ipynb), design three classes that represent a directed graph: you should write a ``Node`` class, an ``Edge`` class, and a ``Graph`` class. Think about what attributes they should have (e.g. ``Edge``s should have weights)."
